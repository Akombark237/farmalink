In modern-\nday use, the term refers primarily to the use of cytotoxic drugs in the treatment of \ncancer. The aim is to deliver enough cytotoxic drug to a cancer-cell target which \nis expressed diff erently compared to normal tissue. Cytotoxic drugs are given at \nintervals (cycles of treatment) to allow recovery of normal tissue.
