# This is a placeholder for the PWA icon
# In a real implementation, you would place actual PNG icon files here
# For now, we'll create a simple SVG that can be converted to PNG

# You can use online tools like:
# - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
# - https://www.favicon-generator.org/
# - Or create custom icons with your PharmaLink branding

# The icon should be 192x192 pixels and represent your PharmaLink brand
# Consider using your logo with a medical cross or pharmacy symbol
