# ⚠️  WARNING: This requirements.txt is for Python projects
# Your PharmaLink project is built with Next.js (JavaScript/Node.js)
# This file will NOT work for your current project

# If you want to convert to Python, you would need these dependencies:
# But this would require completely rewriting your application

# Web Framework
fastapi==0.104.1
uvicorn[standard]==0.24.0
gunicorn==21.2.0

# Database
psycopg2-binary==2.9.9
sqlalchemy==2.0.23
alembic==1.12.1

# Authentication
python-jose[cryptography]==3.3.0
passlib[bcrypt]==1.7.4
python-multipart==0.0.6

# HTTP Requests
httpx==0.25.2
requests==2.31.0

# Environment Variables
python-dotenv==1.0.0

# Data Validation
pydantic==2.5.0

# CORS
fastapi-cors==0.0.6

# Testing
pytest==7.4.3
pytest-asyncio==0.21.1

# Production Server
gunicorn==21.2.0

# Monitoring
sentry-sdk[fastapi]==1.38.0

# NOTE: To use this, you would need to:
# 1. Rewrite all your Next.js API routes in Python
# 2. Convert your React components to a Python template system
# 3. Recreate your authentication system
# 4. Rebuild your database models
# 5. Reimplement all your business logic
#
# This would take weeks of development time.
#
# RECOMMENDED: Use the Node.js deployment options instead!
